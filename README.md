# project_poket_coaching_website

This is my first website project.This website will also become an official website for myself as a poker coach.

I used Figma to build the prototype and design the UX / UI interface of this website.
Then I wrote HTML and CSS for the implementation of RWD web design.

You see the final website from the link below:
